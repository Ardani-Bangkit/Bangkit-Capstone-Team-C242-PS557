# Lensakulitku-App/ML 
in this project we as a Machine Learning team has contribute in Build a model with TensorFlow lite using a data pipeline to present the model. Preprocessing data using data augmentation and training the model using transfer learning & fine tuning method with VGG16 architecture.
