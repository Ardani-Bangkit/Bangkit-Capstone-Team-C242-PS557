# Lensakulitku Application 
LensaKulitku is an innovative application designed to tackle the pressing issue of delayed skin disease detection and limited access to dermatology services. Many individuals face challenges such as long distances to clinics, high medical costs, and a lack of awareness about skin health. These barriers often result in delayed care, leading to worsening health outcomes.

With LensaKulitku, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a convenient, accessible, and affordable solution for early skin disease detection, empowering users to take charge of their skin health from the comfort of their homes.
